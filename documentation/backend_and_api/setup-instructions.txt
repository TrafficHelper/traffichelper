In all installation directions, / represents the root directory of the project
*Note: If an error is occurred with during the installation process, follow the diagnostic methods as long as they don't directly contradict this setup page

Installation:

pip install trafficHelper
cd /backend_and_api/src/backend
pip install requirements.txt

Application setup:

goto /Code/loader.py
uncomment last line
python loader.py
comment back that line
# The line must be commented as otherwise python executes setup() all over again

goto /Constants/constants.py
uncomment last code block
python constants.py
comment last code block
# Commented for same reasons as above block

Part A: Running the Server

    Create the following run config
        module --> uvicorn
        params --> main:app --reload
        wrkdir --> /backend_and_api/src/openapi_server
    Run under this run config
    The server should print setup instructions, and show a link, normally to 127.0.0.1:8000; this can be changed if needed
    Click the link to go to the website, and add '/docs' to its url to obtain the API
    Wait until the API indicates setup is complete (one version should show six checkpoints printed)
    Setting up and running the API server is now complete, and both the beta and normal version can interface from it
    The server may print results during a call: This is debug data helpful for the user and can safely be ignored

Part B: Running the CLI

    It is not recommended that you run the CLI and server together as it may cause race conditions
    goto /User/main.py
    python main.py
    This will open up a CLI
    Follow the instructions in /backend_and_api/Documentation/cli-instructions to run commands and save them

All caveats and shortcomings of the application go here:
- It may not provide optimal solutions to user queries, those being an NP-Hard problem
- The application is greatly data-driven and is thus limited by the input data in its predictions
    - To give more accurate predictions, it must be given more updated data
- The application possesses internal consistency but is limited by the data's consistency.

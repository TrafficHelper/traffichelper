The application also provides a Modification class for a user to edit a network while computing expected changes:
The edit process is represented by a sequence of Modification.


The traffic network contains four types of gadgets, represented by the Gadget class:
- LANE: The number of road lanes in a given road
- SPEED_INCREASE: The number of discrete "blocks" of speed_grading(10) speed increases
- STOP_LIGHT: The number of stop lights at an interval
- SPEED_ENFORCER: Automated speed cameras

Each of them have impacts on:
- risk: (frequency & type) of accidents
- time: (taken for vehicles to cross them)
- dist: the length of the road is not influenced

This can be summarized in the table:

Action:Effect  risk    time    dist
LANE           0.9[1]  -5%[2]
SPEED_INCREASE 0.9[3]  triv    CONST
STOP_LIGHT     0.86[4] 45[5]
SPEED_ENFORCER 0.65[6] 20[7]

triv: Speed increase consists of increasing all 'speed_kph' by the given amount, and recomputing times based on that

Each addition of each Gadget changes the respective parameter by that much

This is the page describing the command line's instructions and functioning
The command line applies to both users and admins
The creation of a command line is invoked by running the command python CLI.exe
It will open a console.
Initially, the program will be setting up the relevant users and tools.
This will terminate with the standard command line starter '>>:' sign appearing followed by a space
By default, the user will begin with the default loaded and precomputed traffic network, and not an admin
Then the individual enters their command.
To exit the console, enter 'exit'. This clears the console and deletes all the user's data
To make the user an admin, enter 'sudo'.
The command line will then prompt a single chance for a password, which must be correctly entered in the next line, else it reverts.
To change the network, type CHANGE [network_filename], which must be a specified GraphML file. It will attempt to load it and make it the User's default network
To save a network state, type SAVE, which will save the current network of the user

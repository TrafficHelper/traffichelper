Data required:

- Traffic Collision Data (covers entire network)
- Road Network (covers entire network)
- Traffic times to cover distance (interpolated)
    - Non-Road-Going vehicles are
    - Road-going vehicles are slowed down based on cumulative traffic.
- Traffic Volume (only some)
    - Road
    - Intersection
    Thus collision data and road network are limited to the Union of all ...
        - Edges/Roads where traffic is counted
        - Intersections where only one direction is not known.
            - Continuous-Time-Markov-Chain is used to create datapoints for other edges, interpolated with time function
- Changes to network
    - Road Segment closures
    - Relative data prior to road construction is equivalent to adding a road to the network
    - Construction (addition of stop lights, stop signs, lane widenings, etc.)

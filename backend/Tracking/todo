Identify datapoints of relevance in:
- RoadCentrelines.csv
- TrafficCollisionData.csv
- MidblockVolume20[22, 23].csv
- IntersectVolume20[15, 22]\20.csv
Place them in the relevant files (Structure, Accident, Flow)_Policy & Overall_Policy

Write Parser method to parse each of this data

Optimal Paths

Best modifications (AIML decision algo. w. modifications having fixed weight ==> Subset-Sum-Problem <= budget & min{sum.lin.metric in selected edges})
    - Each addition or removal of an edge or node consists of an associated accident and volume optimization, change in the Time function
    - This can be quantified as their difference, another time function, with our metric as the integral of the time function. It is stored along an edge
    - We then find change:benefit atomic associations, and maximize the sum while keeping the change below the total budget
        - For now, use greedy metric; this is NP-Hard prob.
        - Later more effective algos.,ex.prob. DP in O(n^2)

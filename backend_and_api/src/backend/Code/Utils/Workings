Characterize how the preferences work and the Utility functions
The Utility functions use OSMnx built off networkx to determine optimal paths
Each edge is assigned an accident risk, (constant flow), travel time and distance
The accident risk is 1 - prod(1 - r) for each edge's r
The travel time is the sum of all the travel times and expected intersection wait time
The distance is sum of all distances along each edge and expected intersection length times number of turns
OSMnx provides previously computed nodeIDs: I
It is easy to convert them to coordinates using their inbuilt 'x' and 'y' parameters
Their names can be accessed through 'name' parameter and consecutive names can be removed if needed
The Preferences adjust the road network;
When the user sets the preferences, their individual average speed (ex. 15 kph for cyclists and 5 kph for pedestrians) is factored
The environment and cost preferences also affect the cost along each network
This creates new weightings which provide different results for different paths

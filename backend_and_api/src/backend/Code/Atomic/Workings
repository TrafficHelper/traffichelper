Consists of the gadgets and vehicles
The Vehicle consists of the method of conveyance. Each vehicle has an associated speed which affects its optimal paths
However, paths are often similar due to common risks
The Gadgets consist of features to modify a road with, which affect flows and travel times
Since adding or removing a gadget makes a change to the traffic data for that network, changes are imputed based on cutting-edge research
See the references for that data

Gadgets:

The traffic network contains four types of gadgets, represented by the Gadget class:
- LANE: The number of road lanes in a given road
- SPEED_INCREASE: The number of discrete "blocks" of speed_grading(10) speed increases
- STOP_LIGHT: The number of stop lights at an interval
- SPEED_ENFORCER: Automated speed cameras

Each of them have impacts on:
- risk: (frequency & type) of accidents
- time: (taken for vehicles to cross them)
- dist: the length of the road is not influenced

This can be summarized in the table [36]:

Action:Effect  risk    time    dist
LANE           0.9[1]  -5%[2]
SPEED_INCREASE 0.9[3]  triv    CONST
STOP_LIGHT     0.86[4] 45[5]
SPEED_ENFORCER 0.65[6] 20[7]

triv: Speed increase consists of increasing all 'speed_kph' by the given amount, and recomputing times based on that

Each addition of each Gadget changes the respective parameter by that much

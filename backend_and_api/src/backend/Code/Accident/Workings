Consists of the Accidents and inducing Environment
The Accident consists of an Environment in which it occurred, time and Outcome
The Outcome consists of a Vehicle with an Injury level
(note that pedestrians are also considered vehicles so their injuries are also accounted)
The accident's location is also recorded in the loader.py file's load_accidents() method
Each environment has a grading relating to its amenability for changing accident level
OpenOttawa does not record the distribution of injuries and accidents
Thus these are assigned in shifting priority order
